>Darunavir is a **protease inhibitor** used to treat HIV. It acts on the **HIV aspartyl protease** which the virus needs to cleave the HIV polyprotein into its functional fragments.

## Pharmacodynamics
>
Darunavir is an inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease. In studies, the drug, co-administered with ritonavir in combination therapy, significantly reduced viral load and increased CD4 cell counts in this treatment-experienced patient population (Tibotec, 2006, Product Monograph, Prezista 2006). Darunavir is used as an adjunct therapy with low dose ritonavir, which inhibits cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) which increases the bioavailability and half life of darunavir.

## Mechanism of action
>
Darunavir is a HIV protease inhibitor which prevents HIV replication by binding to the enzyme's active site, thereby preventing the dimerization and the catalytic activity of the HIV-1 protease. Darunavir selectively inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol polyproteins in virus-infected cells, which prevents the formation of mature infectious virus particles. Structual analyses suggests that the close contact that darunavir has with the main chains of the protease active site amino acids (Asp-29 and Asp-30) is an important contributing factor to its potency and wide spectrum of activity against multi-protease inhibitor resistant HIV-1 variants. **Darunavir can also adapt to the changing shape of a protease enzyme because of its molecular flexibility. Darunavir is known to bind to two distinct sites on the enzyme: the active site cavity and the surface of one of the flexible flaps in the protease dimer.**

## Targets

Human immunodeficiency virus 1

inhibitor, Q72874

Aspartic-type endopeptidase activity

## Enzymes
Cytochrome P450 3A4

substrate, Inhibitor, P08684

## side effects
Darunavir is generally well tolerated by people. Rash is the most common side effect (7% of patients). Other common side effects are diarrhea (2.3%), headache (3.8%), abdominal pain (2.3%), constipation (2.3%), and vomiting (1.5%). Darunavir can also cause allergic reactions, and people allergic to ritonavir can also have a reaction to darunavir.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darunavir#cite_note-:0-9)

## Drug interactions
Darunavir may interact with medications commonly taken by people with HIV/AIDS such as other antiretrovirals, and antacids such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists.[9] St. John's wort may reduce the effectiveness of darunavir by increasing the breakdown of darunavir by the metabolic enzyme CYP3A.[9]
